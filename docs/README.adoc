Excel VBA class providing Brent's method for finding a root of an equation.

This is essentially a rewrite of class I originally found at {uri-quantcode-brent}, which unfortunately isn't available any more.

== Features

* supports additional function arguments (besides _x_)
* status and error messages so you know what's going on
* optionally you can provide a guess where to start the search

== Prerequisites / Dependencies

Since this is an Excel VBA class you obviously need Microsoft Excel.

[#how-to-install]
== How to install / Getting started

Add the file(s) from the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder to your project.
Yes, it's that simple.

._If you need some more advice on how to do that, expand me._
[%collapsible]
====
. Open Microsoft Excel.
. Open the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) (kbd:[Alt+F11]).
. Add the file(s) in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder to your VBA project.
** With {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck]:
.. Right-click on the project to which you want to add the file(s) in the "`Code Explorer`" (to show it press kbd:[Ctrl+R]) and click on menu:Add[Existing Files...].
.. Select all files in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder and click on btn:[Open].
** Without Rubberduck:
.. Select all files in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder in Windows File Explorer.
.. Drag-and-drop them to the corresponding project in VBE's "`Project Explorer`". +
   (To show it press kbd:[Ctrl+R].
   Hit it twice if the Code Explorer shows up first.)
// BUG: "project name" can't be put in normal angle brackets, because the closing bracket would be interpreted as menu delimiter. I couldn't find a way how to "escape" that (i.e. a backslash didn't work). Thus, single guillemets are used.
. Check, if there are obvious errors by compiling the project (menu:Debug[Compile â€¹project nameâ€º]).
. Save the file/project.
.. Be sure that the file/project you want to save is "`active`" in the VBE by checking, if its name is shown in VBE's title bar. +
   (If it's not, open a (class) module of the corresponding project (and close it again).)
.. Press the "`Save`" button (the disc symbol similar to ðŸ’¾) in VBE's toolbar.
.. Check that the file (really) was saved by having a look at the "`last modified date`" of the (project) file in the Windows File Explorer.

== Usage / Show it in action

For simplicity let's simply find some roots of a second order polynomial function.
First, we define the parabola function in a module as

[source,vba]
----
Public Function Parabola( _
    ByVal x As Double, _
    Optional ByVal a2 As Double = 1, _
    Optional ByVal a1 As Double = 0, _
    Optional ByVal a0 As Double = 0 _
        ) As Double
    Parabola = a2 * x ^ 2 + a1 * x + a0
End Function
----

We will use the the parameters `+a2 = 1+`, `+a1 = 3+` and `+a0 = -4+` for our tests.
Since this is no rocket science, you can easily find analytically that the roots are then located at `+x1 = -4+` and `+x2 = 1+`.
Now let's search for the left root (`+x1+`) with the Brent class e.g. with

[source,vba]
----
Public Sub ParabolaRootSearch()
    Dim Brent As clsBrent
    Set Brent = New clsBrent

    With Brent
        .LowerBound = -6
        .UpperBound = -2
        .Guess = -5
        .Arr = Array(1, 3, -4)
        .FunctionName = "'" & Replace$(ThisWorkbook.Name, "'", "''") & "'!" & "Parabola"

        Dim Root As Variant
        Root = .Solve

        If .Status <> eBrentStatus.eNoError Then
            Debug.Print "Oh no ..."
        Else
            Debug.Print Root
        End If
    End With
End Sub
----

which can be added to the same module as the function definition.
(Before running/executing the above procedure, of course you need to add the Brent class to the workbook/the project as well.)
With that I get the result -3.99999995967464 which is pretty close to the analytical solution.
If you want to increase the accuracy, add e.g. `+.Accuracy = 0.00000001+` to the Brent options.
Add `+.Silent = False+` as well and you'll get

[source]
----
'mod_Test_clsBrent.xlsm'!Parabola   -6  -2
  SolveX(9) = -4    (4,44089209850063E-15)

in the Immediate Window.
The first row states the call with the given bounds and in the second you get the result, where the `+9+` indicates the number of iterations and the number in brackets on the right calculated _y_ value.

== Running Tests

Yes, {uri-UnitTests}[Unit Tests] in Excel _are_ possible.
For that you need to have the awesome {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck] AddIn installed (and enabled).

The procedure is very similar to the one given in the <<how-to-install>> section, but this time add the files from the link:{testdir}[tests] folder (instead of the files from the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder).
When you are done with that, additionally perform the following steps.

. Check that the files from the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder are present in the project as well or that you have a reference to project with the source files.footnote:[
   See the collapsible in the next point on how to do that.
   If you use the Rubberduck way, before adding the reference you first need to switch to the menu:Projects[] tab.
] +
  (Otherwise tests will/should fail.)
. Add a reference to the "`Rubberduck AddIn`" to the project (with the test modules).
+
._If you don't have a clue how to do that, expand me._
[%collapsible]
====
* With {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck]:
. Right-click somewhere on the project in the "`Code Explorer`" and click on menu:Add/Remove{sp}References...[].
. Add the reference.
.. Type (parts of) the library name in the search box until you see it in below (left) list or it is empty.
** If the AddIn file name is in the lower left list box:
... Select the library in the (left) list and
... click on the btn:[âž¨] button to add it to the project references. +
** If the the AddIn file name is _not_ in the list:
... Click on the btn:[Browse...] button.
... Browse to the folder where the AddIn is located.
... Select the AddIn and
... press the btn:[Open] button.
. Click on the btn:[OK] button to close the window.
* Without Rubberduck:
. Open the Reference manager in the VBE (menu:Tools[References...]).
** If the AddIn project name is in the list of available references:
.. Add a checkmark to the corresponding library.
** If it's _not_ in the list:
.. Click on the btn:[Browse...] button.
.. Browse to the folder where the AddIn is located.
.. Select the AddIn and
.. press the btn:[Open] button.
. Click on the btn:[OK] button to close the window.
. Save the file/project.

+
. Open the "`Test Explorer`" (menu:Rubberduck[Unit Tests > Test Explorer]).
. Run the tests by clicking menu:Run[All Tests].

All contributions are highly welcome!!

If you are new to git/GitHub, please have a look at {uri-GitHub-FirstContribution} where you will find a lot of useful information for beginners.

I recently was pointed to {uri-commit-messages} which sounds very promising.
I'll use them from now on too (and hopefully don't forget it in a hurry).

What are the `+'@...+` comments good for in the code?::
You should really have a look at the awesome {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck] project!
